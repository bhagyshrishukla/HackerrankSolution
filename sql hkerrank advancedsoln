The ranking calculation is ok. But use conditional aggregation instead of three joins to build the results:

with cte as (
    select id
         , name
         , dense_rank() over (partition by id order by score desc) as dr
    from t
)
select id
     , group_concat(case when dr = 1 then name end separator ', ') as `first`
     , group_concat(case when dr = 2 then name end separator ', ') as `second`
     , group_concat(case when dr = 3 then name end separator ', ') as `third`
from cte
where dr <= 3
group by id

SELECT 
        algorithm,
        SUM(volume) as volume,
        datepart(quarter,dt) as quarters
        
FROM    coins c
JOIN    transactions t ON t.coin_code = c.code
WHERE   datepart(year,dt) = 2020
GROUP BY algorithm, datepart(quarter,dt)
